RMS
===

Record Management System is a basic web application that demonstrates various approaches to solving common problems that arise during development of a Google Web Toolkit (GWT) application.

It demonstrates architecture and design concepts without the distracting and arbitrary business rules and edge cases that are present in typical production applications, and is intended to be a point of discussion for further exploration and improvement instead of a hard design guideline.

The following features are demonstrated in RMS, among others:
* Real-time, inline, user input validation
* Basic widgets to minimize complexity of views and reduce code duplication
* Page navigation via Activities and Places
* Centralization of user interface text via configuration and properties files (i18n compatible).
* GWT-style resource and image referencing
* UiBinder to simplify and separate the structure and wiring of a view
* AJAX RPC Services
* ...and more!
